With the efforts of our team members from Smarala, we have picked some of the financial forgotten girls who have an in born talent and deserve a great education. We hope to do the most we can for a better future for these girls and many more such girls across the country.

Hope to bring joy to more lives going forward with your continued support. We urge you to join in our humble cause for a better society.
